# Armour Bundles
Simple mod that adds an item that can store up to 12 pieces of armour, along with 3 different profiles
## Setting Profiles
To set a profile on an armour bundle, you crouch-right click with the item until the profile you want to set is selected.

After the profile has been selected, right clicking with the bundle will set the profile to the armour you currently have equipped.

Now you can use the keybindings to swap between profiles as long as the bundle is both in your inventory and contains the armour for said profile.
